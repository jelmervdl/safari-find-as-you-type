# safari-find-as-you-type

A Safari extension that adds "Find As You Type" functionality, similar to Firefox.

On a webpage, type to search for a word. A small indicator at the bottom right of the page will show your search, and the corresponding word on the page will be selected. If it's a link, you can press enter and you will navigate to the new page.

By design, the indicator is very small — because most of the time, you will simply search a link, click it and boom, done.

## Bugs

- A deletion (sometimes) doesn't appear in the field but the search will work nonetheless… ¯_(ツ)_/¯
- The copy feature is not working 100% of the time. Same for cmd-g/cmd-shift-g. This is non-important for me, and I'm thinking about removing them.
